## 💻 My Works

I've been programming since I was a kid at elementary school! Here are some of what I made :)

### ❤️ Notable open-source projects

I love open-source, seriously. It has always been a place for me to learn and connect with talented people!

 - [📦 zipalign-java](https://github.com/iyxan23/zipalign-java), full reimplementation of Android Build System's zipalign in pure java.
 - [🍱 OpenBlocks](https://github.com/OpenBlocksTeam), attempt at creating a scratch-inspired modular android app IDE in android.
 - [💫 Blokkok](https://github.com/Blokkok), second attempt at creating a fully modular scratch-inspired android app IDE in android.
 - [🌻 rafflesia](https://github.com/iyxan23/rafflesia), fully-fledged programming language that compiles into Sketchware projects, written in rust.
 - [🗜️ swrs](https://github.com/iyxan23/swrs), rust parser and abstraction layer over Sketchware project files. at [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/swrs)
 - [📜 eplk](https://github.com/iyxan23/eplk), hobby programming language made from scratch with Kotlin with focus on extensibility.
